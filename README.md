                                 Challenge 2 - VBA Scripting

 
 **Introduction**  Multiple Year Stock Data
 
 **Data Description** 

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

**Analysis** 

- The "TickerCalculation" subroutine processes data across multiple worksheets to analyze stock information. 
    Header Setup: Summary Table columns are labeled to organize data.

- Variable Initialization: Variables store ticker names, opening/closing prices, yearly/percentage changes, and total stock volumes.

- Iteration Through Data: Each dataset row is analyzed individually.

- Initial Data Check: It confirms if the row is the dataset's first entry and sets the initial opening price.

- Ticker Data Processing: Data for each ticker is processed, calculating changes and updating the Summary Table.

- Conditional Formatting: Yearly and percentage changes are formatted based on positivity.

- Bonus Summary Table Setup: Additional values are set for the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.

- Bonus Summary Calculation: It computes the highest changes and volumes for each ticker.

- Output: Calculated values are displayed in the bonus summary table.

- Loop Through Worksheets: The analysis is repeated for every worksheet, ensuring comprehensive data analysis.
    
The VBA script runs on all sheets successfully by using a "For Each" loop to iterate through each worksheet. Within this loop, the script conducts calculations and operations on each sheet independently, enabling it to handle data from multiple sheets automatically. This method ensures seamless analysis across all sheets, resulting in accurate outcomes.
  
**Results** 
The script figures out yearly and percent changes for each stock ticker, helping to see how they perform. It uses colors to show good changes in green and bad changes in red, making it easier to see. It also finds which stocks went up or down the most, helping to understand risk. Plus, it finds the most traded stock, showing where investors are putting their money. Looking at different stocks gives an idea of what's happening in the market, making it easier to decide where to invest. In short, the script helps understand how stocks are doing and what's happening in the market, making it easier to make smart investment choices.

  **Acknowledgements** 
  The VBA script was developed independently, utilizing the resources provided by Microsoft Excel's VBA environment. 
  The code was adapted from class materials. Collaboration with Astrid Apopa and Grace Shi was very helpful in completing the assignment.
  The VBA script was developed with the assistance of the practice conducted in class titled "census_pt1_solution.vbs".
